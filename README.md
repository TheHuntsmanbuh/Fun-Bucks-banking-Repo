<h1>FUNBUCKS APPS</h1>
this is an extremely simple group of apps that all share the same currency, funbucks.
dont ask why its just funny :)
ok but realy the reason im making all of this is to test my ability to make an app (or multiple) that share a score and maybe even accounts (big maybe).

<h2>/////STILL-VERY-WORK-IN-PROGRESS\\\\\</h2>

<p>BEFORE GOING ON VERY IMPORTNT</p>
<p>everything here also requires you pip install PyQt6 and pip install PyQt6-tools (or however you want to install it) please note that these are essential to it working as it uses pyqt for its ui elements :)</p>
most of this code (when you see it) will be at most <b>days</b> old.
honestly i havent got much done yet but i will put a checklist for progress in the readme

you can do whatever you want with this project, just either credit me or change it enough to not be recognizeable.
